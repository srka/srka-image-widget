# Srka Image Widget #

An easy to use image widget utilizing the new media manager in WordPress 3.5. It may look simple, but there are plenty of opportunities to modify its behavior via the various built in hooks.

This plugin is based on Brady Vercher's Simple Image Widget (3.0.3) plugin. 

Changes:
* I added a separate Image Link field.
